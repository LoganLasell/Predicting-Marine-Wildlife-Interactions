# High Value Species Dashboard

## Project Summary

This project is a Shiny dashboard that visualizes high-value marine species catch data from local fisheries. Users can explore trends in total catch, species composition, and spatial distribution. The app also includes an AI chatbot that allows users to ask questions about the dataset and receive insights based on SQL queries.

Research Question: How does hook/set effort and species type correlate with the likelihood and intensity of protected or high species interactions? Can I implement a Bayesian Logistic Regression model to predict the probability of at least one protected or high-value species interaction using hook/set effort and species information from MRIP survey data?



### Data Description

The dataset contains records of marine species catches, including species name, total catch, fishing mode, and location. Each row represents a unique trip or catch event. The data has been cleaned and standardized for use in the dashboard.
