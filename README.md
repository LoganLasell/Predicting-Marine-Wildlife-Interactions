High Value Species Dashboard
Project Summary

This project is a Shiny dashboard that visualizes high-value marine species catch data from local fisheries. Users can explore trends in total catch, species composition, and spatial distribution, and interactively view time series for selected sites. The app also includes an AI chatbot that allows users to ask questions about the dataset and receive insights based on SQL queries.

Data Description

The dataset contains records of marine species catches, including species name, sex, total catch, fishing mode, and location. Each row represents a unique trip or catch event. The data has been cleaned and standardized for use in the dashboard.
